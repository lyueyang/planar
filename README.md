Project scope:
Brief: An enhanced study planner integrated with Luminus for better ease of use.
Descriptive: Planar is a study planner that comes in the form of a web application and a desktop application. Planar intends to simplify the process of notetaking and keeping track of due dates for assignments for students. The application is also integrated with Luminus to allow for quick access to vital module information for students while also leveraging decentralised file-sharing between students to reduce the server load for hosting.


User stories:
1.As a student who sits through lecture and felt like they are unsure of a certain concept, they can note down the topic or the slide number easily for the module.

2.As a student who has multiple assignments to work on, the assignments can be noted down in each of the module tabs/pages. The assignments will be compiled in another tab which allows them to easily visualise all of their submissions due. The assignments can then be sorted by various factors such as due date, alphabetical order of modules or personally defined order.

3.As a student, coordinating project work and meetings are often hard. When assignments are marked as projects, they can add other users to share the project details with. This would allow them to come up with to-do lists for the project whereby they can assign work to various members. Simultaneously, as project meetings are hard to coordinate, users can indicate their availability on a calendar to find which date is the best for them to have the meeting.

4.As a student, you may be working across multiple computers and you may also need to share files with other platforms. As such, users can make use of integrated synchronising software such as Syncthing which does not have a limit on file sizes. This would alleviate the load on our platform as files are not saved on our servers but instead users are transferring files directly to one another. This also adds for additional privacy for users.


Core features:
1.Telegram bot for users to quickly access user data

2.Notetaking and assignment deadline tracking

3.Filesharing for group assignments
